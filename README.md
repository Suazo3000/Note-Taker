## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly application for saving notes. Often, we end up with numerous notebooks containing a large number of notes, making it difficult to find the ones we need. This application centralizes all your notes in one location, simplifying the organization process. During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into backend functionality and learned how to seamlessly connect the frontend with the backend, resulting in a comprehensive full-stack application. Another important concept I have learned is how to deploy our application to a live website.
